# Kanbas Learning (Canvas Clone)

**End-To-End Deployed Application:** [Kanbas Learning](https://quizzes--kanbas-react-web-app-f24.netlify.app/#/Kanbas)

### **Note:**
1) Please give it a few minutes to load as the backend server may take some time to initialize. You might see a blank white screen for up to 30 seconds.
2) User credentials are available at `src/Kanbas/Database/users.json`, or you can sign up to create a new account.
3) For illustration purpose any user can change their role to **Student** or **Faculty**. This is done just for any user to verify all the functionalities of the Kanbas WebApp. In real scenario only the **Admin** can change roles of the users.
